# Contributing
First of all: Thank you very much for thinking about contributing to the P4wnP1 project.
There are several tasks that need to be done, even some for people that are [[not developers|Other Ways to Contribute]].

Here are some places where you can find some suggestions:
* [Github issue page](https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1/issues)
* [Mame's ToDo list](https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1/tree/master/todo.txt)
* [[The Wikis ToDo list|ToDo]]

## How do I contribute?
This depends on what you want to do:

### Contributing to the P4wnP1 code:
Contributions to the code follow the standard scheme for contributing:
* fork [the P4wnP1 Repository](https://github.com/MaMe82/P4wnP1).
* use `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/P4wnP1` _this won't clone the submodules required for running P4wnP1_
* setup the upstream repo so you can update your fork: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/MaMe82/P4wnP1`
* make a new branch `git checkout -b <desired name of the branch>`
* make your changes, add, and commit them.
* push them to your remote repository `git push upstream <name of your branch>`
* Clone your fork on the Pi and test your changes!
* PR them once you tested them thoroughly on github and hope they get merged.

### Contributing to the P4wnP1 Wiki:
Unfortunately, there is no PR feature for Wikis. Thats why the best current solution for posting feedback on the Wiki, would be to upload the changed files in an issue on the Wiki page.
We might move to a different wiki solution but this is the only way until then.
