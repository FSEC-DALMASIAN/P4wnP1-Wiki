# Other ways to Contribute

**Even if you are not a developer or very familiar with P4wnP1, you can still contribute to the progress of the project**  
There are several things that need to be done:
* Proofreading of the entire Wiki for grammatical/informational errors. We are just humans like you. ;-)  
* Since this list isn't the central ToDo list, you will find up-to-date Wiki todo list [here](ToDo).

## Styleguide
This repo uses the default github-webinterface characters for styling
* \`[code]\` singleline code
* \`\`\`[multiline code]\`\`\` multiline code
* `*` unordered lists
* `-` unordered list indent
* `1.` ordered list
* `---` horizontal line
* `![alt-text](url)` image
* `[text](url)` hyperlink
* `**text**` bold
* `_text_` italic
* `[[display-name|page-name]]` internal link

### youtube videos
Since githubs wiki backend "golem" doesn't allow iFrames, the current workaround is to add a the thumbnail with the link to the video:
This can be done with the following syntax:  
`[![alt-text](thumbnail-link)](video-link)`  
_alt-text_ should be a descriptive name  
_thumbnail-link_ the url   `https://img.youtube.com/vi/<video_id>/0.jpg`  
_video-link_ is the link to the video   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video_id>`

**video_id** is the part after _?v=_ in every   video link.  
Example:  
`[![P4wnP1 LockPicker demo youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZXNQNIpm7s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZXNQNIpm7s)`  
will be rendered to:  
[![P4wnP1 LockPicker demo youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZXNQNIpm7s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZXNQNIpm7s)
